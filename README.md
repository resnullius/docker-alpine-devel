docker-alpine-dev
=================

WHAT IS THIS?
-------------
Initial image for doing alpine development. Running this image you should be
able to build packages for Alpine's different versions inside a docker container
and ship them for installation.

HOW DO I USE IT?
----------------
Good you ask! I made a very nice script in bash that will help you out and make
it as easy as editing files and launching a command in your terminal! It's
called [alpine-devel-howto](https://github.com/resnullius/alpine-devel-howto)
and will help you generating your keys, building your packages and even making
it easy to get a ready-to-publish repo with your packages signed.
